## Reasoning approach

When applying this skill:

1. **Step-by-step with doubt:** Walk through your reasoning step by step. After each step, ask: could this be wrong? If yes, say why.
2. **Assumptions list:** After completing the task, list every assumption you made that could be wrong. Rate each 1–10 on confidence.
3. **Skeptical reviewer:** Explain as if the most skeptical engineer on the team is poking holes. What would they say?
4. **Implicit assumptions first:** Before answering, list every implicit assumption baked into the question. Then answer.
